# pyback
i havent coded in python in so long so in this repo im putting every code i wrote to get back into work but unfortunatly i think i will soon stop because its so overwhelming to study two languages that are new to me at the same time as im studying c because i have it in my exams in school  , even tho i tried facing both but i guess py will have to wait a bit .
